## Grepolis Data Storage for NodeJS
This is a small library for importing Grepolis data and properly storing it into a MongoDB instance. This library helps to reduce requests to the Grepolis API by only reading data when the data is updated. It also tracks changes in data. This is still under development and is not ready for use. This library is rather large and a lot of work needs to be completed before it is ready for use.

#### Installation
```
npm i grepolis-storage --save
```

#### Usage
